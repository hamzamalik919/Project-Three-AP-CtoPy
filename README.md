# Project-Three-AP-CtoPy
1. The porject is actually working on the text file. extract the information from the text file using the python code and call the funciton which is created in python. we have the the list of items in a text file called input.txt First count the number of items in the file, then add the asteriks to the each items hwo many times the each items in the file, then we search for the particular item in a file using the python and C++. 
2. I prefer to code in python. 
3. By learning the Data structure and algorithms I would imporve my code and enhance the code and more secure and fast. 
4. To read a text file from the file using the python this is area in which I didn't work before that's why now I am very compfortable on it. through zybooks and there are many online sources are there which help me to do that. 
5. The integration of the C++ and python code I am sure that it would help me in the future courses or work and, work on the text file.
6. By using the clear naming convention adding the proper comment on the code. if I work on the github then I will commit my every single change which I made in the project in future which is super helpfull and supportive.
